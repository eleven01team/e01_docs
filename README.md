# GETTING STARTED
## OVERVIEW

Eleven01 is one of the fastest, highly-scalable blockchain protocol which aims to make blockchain technologies ready for real world use. We aim at establishing India as a benchmark for public as well as private workloads. Secure by default and privacy-focused, the Eleven01 protocol employs cutting-edge blockchain research to achieve high throughput through dynamic consensus and is designed to scale up to several thousand transactions per second.

Eleven01 provides a platform for developers to create, publish, and extend the core blockchain services beyond the core blockchain ledger. One of the biggest USPs of the Eleven01 protocol is the use of Oracles that will allow large-scale traditional centralized applications to incorporate blockchain into their existing infrastructure.

## ABOUT ELEVEN01

Eleven01 is India’s first-ever native protocol built to be capable of one of the fastest and most highly scalable blockchain protocols. It aims to take blockchain technologies to the next billion people, preparing for real world use cases. We strive to create a benchmark for public as well as private workloads. Secure by default and privately focused, the Eleven01 protocol employs cutting edge blockchain research to achieve high throughput through dynamic consensus.

Eleven01 provides a platform that allows developers a means to create, publish and extend the core blockchain services beyond the core blockchain ledger. One of the biggest USPs of Eleven01 protocol is the use of Oracles. This will allow large scale, traditional, centralised applications to employ blockchain into their existing infrastructure. It is designed from the ground up to be a use-case agnostic, topology-agnostic blockchain ledger.
Eleven01 protocol core software can be used to implement a public blockchain offering a cryptocurrency for anyone to join and transact with. It is also configured as a private, permissioned blockchain that can be used to build consortiums. In addition we are creating a “Marketplace”, where companies can buy, rent, or subscribe to smart contracts and services that will seamlessly integrate with Eleven01 chains.

The core features of Eleven01 include:

1. Dynamic consensus
2. Two tier identity verification 
3. Marketplace 
4. Customisable Oracle Implementation 
5. Identity management, Node management 
6. Usage of Key vault 

Eleven01 a competitive advantage over other blockchains. Implementing different consensus model for getting dynamic nature which includes IBFT, Raft, Clique PoA along with PoW.

## EXPLORE IN ELEVEN01

Eleven01 is a robust blockchain protocol, designed from the ground up to be a use-case agnostic, topology-agnostic blockchain ledger. It’s core software can be used to implement a public chain, offering a cryptocurrency that anyone can join and transact with. It can also be configured as a private, permissioned blockchain that can be used to build consortiums.

The goal is to provide a foundation that can be built upon and tailored to each application. The objective of this whitepaper is to discuss the features and USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of the Eleven01 protocol without going into the details of any of its specific implementation.

In addition to the protocol, we will also be unveiling the Eleven01 “Marketplace”, a place where companies can buy, rent, or subscribe to smart contracts and services that will seamlessly integrate with Eleven01 chains. The Eleven01 Marketplace is powered and run on our own protocol and thus enjoys all the features that Eleven01 has to offer
